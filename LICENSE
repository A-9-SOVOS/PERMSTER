1. Definitions
   1.1 "Licensed Material" means the code, algorithms, documentation, designs, methods and any other materials (source or binary) distributed with the project to which this License is attached.
   1.2 "Licensee" means any person or entity that receives the Licensed Material and accepts the terms of this License.
   1.3 "Licensor" means the copyright owner or other party granting rights under this License (hereinafter the originator identified in the project). For this repository, the Licensor is The Arc-9 Foundation unless otherwise specified.
   1.4 "Gross Revenue" means the total revenue received by the Licensee (or a sublicensee) from the sale, licensing, distribution, hosting, commercialization or other monetization of products or services that incorporate, derive from, or are substantially enabled by the Licensed Material, without deduction for costs, taxes, or other expenses.

2. Grant of License
   2.1 Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Licensor hereby grants to you (the Licensee) a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-bearing license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and sublicense the Licensed Material, subject to the royalty and obligations set below.

3. Royalty and Payment
   3.1 Royalty Rate: A royalty equal to four percent (4%) of Gross Revenue attributable to the Licensee's commercial use of the Licensed Material (the "Royalty") is payable to the Licensor.
   3.2 Triggering Events: A Royalty is due whenever a company, organization, or commercial entity receives Gross Revenue from a product or service that incorporates, depends on, or otherwise benefits from the Licensed Material. Individual users and developers using the Licensed Material for personal, hobbyist, academic, or non-commercial purposes—regardless of whether they are later monetized through unrelated channels—are expressly excluded from Royalty obligations. Only entities that commercialize the Licensed Material itself (or products/services substantially built upon it) owe royalties.
   3.3 Accounting and Payment: Licensee shall keep accurate books and records of all amounts that are or may be subject to Royalty. Royalty payments are due on a quarterly basis within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar quarter, accompanied by a statement showing Gross Revenue and Royalty calculation for that period.
   3.4 Sublicensing: A Licensee may grant sublicenses but shall remain responsible for payment of Royalty on revenues received by its sublicensees (and shall require its sublicensees to remit their portion to the Licensee so that the Licensee may satisfy the obligations hereunder).

4. Attribution and Notices
   4.1 Attribution: The Licensee shall preserve any copyright and attribution notices the Licensor places in the Licensed Material, and shall include the following notice in documentation and about or legal pages for any commercial product or service that uses the Licensed Material: "Contains software or methods provided under the Arc-9 Open Royalty Agreement (The Arc-9 Foundation)."
   4.2 Notices & Contact: The Licensee shall send all Royalty statements and payments, and any notices or correspondence related to this License, to the Licensor at the contact details provided in the project or otherwise supplied by the Licensor.

5. Modifications and Improvements
   5.1 The Licensee may modify the Licensed Material. Substantial derivative versions of the Licensed Material distributed commercially remain subject to the Royalty obligations when those versions are monetized.

6. Termination
   6.1 This License may be terminated by the Licensor upon material breach by the Licensee if the Licensee fails to cure that breach within thirty (30) days of receiving written notice. Without prejudice to other rights, termination does not relieve the Licensee of its obligation to pay accrued, unpaid Royalties up to the effective date of termination.

7. Warranties, Disclaimers and Limits of Liability
   7.1 Warranty: The Licensed Material is provided "AS IS". Licensor makes no express warranties; to the fullest extent permitted by law, Licensor disclaims implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.
   7.2 Liability: In no event shall Licensor be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of the use or inability to use the Licensed Material.

8. Compliance and Audit
   8.1 The Licensor may request reasonable records to confirm Gross Revenue and Royalty payments and Licensee shall permit an independent auditor to inspect books and records once per year upon reasonable notice. Confidential business information may be protected under reasonable confidentiality terms during such an audit.

9. Other Rights
   9.1 The Licensor retains all copyrights, moral rights, and other intellectual property rights in the Licensed Material not expressly granted in this License.

10. Governing Law
   10.1 This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws chosen by the Licensor and made available in the project documentation (if no jurisdiction is specified, the parties should agree prior to use or consult counsel).

11. Miscellaneous
